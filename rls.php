<h2>Terms of Service</h2>
<div class="lists">
<div class="box">
<center><font size="2.5">By betting your skins here at <b>CSGOCAFE.CF</b>, you agree to our following rules and regulations, as well as agree to our <b>Privacy Policy</b>:</font></CENTER>
<ul>
<li>
<br>
<p><span>1.</span><font size="3"><b>Importance of reading the TOS.</b><br></font><font size="2"> Reading through our TOS will help you understand the risk factors of betting and also give you a better understanding on the website. We recommend that you read through the TOS thoroughly before gambling. By using CSGOCAFE.CF, you are agreeing to be bound by these Terms of Service at all times and agree you are responsible for compliance with any applicable local laws. If you don't agree with these terms of service, you are not permitted to use CSGOCAFE.CF. The materials contained within this website are our own and must not be republished unless allowed by Staff (see #11).</font></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>2.</span><font size="3"><b>You are at least 18 years or older.</b><br></font><font size="2">By betting on CSGOCAFE.CF you agree you are 18 years of age or older.</font></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>3.</span><font size="3"><b>You agree to the prices we value your skins at.</b><br></font><font size="2">All of the skins that can be found on the market are valued at the lowest market price and are subject to change at any time, to the value we desire, if we suspect price manipulation. The skins that fall into the $400+ category, that are not found on the market, are valued by our CSGOCAFE.CF staff team. If you do not agree to our prices that we value your skins at, please don't bet. Our bots are not capable of valuing for example, a certain amount of blue on a case hardened skin. Therefore we take the average price of the skin itself without certain looks and price them accordingly.</font></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>4.</span><font size="3"><b>Skins over market value.</b><br></font><font size="2">If for some reason the skin you are betting is not in our database/shown on that list your item will be valued at $0.00 and may not able to be retrieved. Make sure to double check the list above that our CSGOCAFE.CF staff team has created. If for some reason you find an item that is not listed there, please leave us a message at our feedback section which can be found under the Contact Us page.</font></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>5.</span><font size="3"><b>You agree to gamble safely. </b><br></font><font size="2">We care greatly about the users of our website and want nothing but the best for them! Remember to always gamble safely and don't get tempted into entering a pot out of your own will. Once your bet is placed and it goes through, it can't be retracted/given back.</font></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>6.</span><font size="3"><b>You agree to bet at your own risk. </b><br></font><font size="2">As said previously, once your bet is placed it can't be retracted/given back. Make sure when betting on CSGOCAFE.CF you know the risk factor of losing and are willing to lose the skins you bet. The one thing that should always be remembered when gambling is to only risk what you're willing to lose.</font></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>7.</span><font size="3"><b>Understanding the 2% rule. </b><br></font><font size="2">Here at CSGOCAFE.CF we take about 2% of each pot to help keep the website running for our users! The exact percentage varies from pot to pot, but we aim for 2%, and never take more than 5%. It is a very small percentage but it really does help. Before betting it is good to fully understand this rule without making assumptions that the full pot value was not given to the winner. By betting you do agree to this term and understand that any skins can be taken from the pot so long as their combined value is less than 10%. You must understand and agree that all profits we receive here at CSGOCAFE.CF are in virtual skins. We don't receive any real money transactions/profits directly from the websites services and what is done with the virtual skins after they are traded from our bots is in no way directly connected with CSGOCAFE.CF</font></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>8.</span><font size="3"><b>You will not create imposter accounts of our bots/staff team in an attempt to scam our users. </b><br></font><font size="2">Here at CSGOCAFE.CF we take scamming as a very serious matter and do not want to see our users get into any type of scam situation. For this reason we feel it is necessary to make our users aware that our Staff will NEVER ask for items from you. Do not fall a victim to the imposter accounts users may create. If you are reported/caught creating fraudulent accounts of our website we will file a series of reports to Valve and take the matters into our own hands. If you are found making any type of imposter account you will also be blacklisted from the CSGOCAFE.CF website and we will do our best to inform our users of these accounts so they do not fall for these scams. Gamrspub is the only Owner/Staff with a personal steam account, anyone else claiming to be affiliated with CSGOCAFE.CF is not, don't be fooled. If you are scammed by an unofficial CSGOCAFE.CF account we CANNOT assist you/replace your skins.</font></p>

<p><span>9.</span><font size="3"><b>Site Bans.</b><br></font><font size="2">CSGOCAFE.CF reserves the right to remove a user's acces to our website for any reason, and CSGOCAFE.CF is not obligated to provide a reason for denial of access to the user.</font></p>
